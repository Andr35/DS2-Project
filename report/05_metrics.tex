\section{Evaluation Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}

Our aim is to build a perfect failure detector.
A perfect failure detector has 2 properties: strong completeness (every crashed process is eventually reported to the tracker) and strong accuracy (no false positives are reported).

An experiment is considered unsuccessful if any of these circumstances occur:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a faulty node is not reported by all correct nodes
    \item a faulty node is reported before the expected crash happens
    \item there are reappearance reports
    \item there are duplicated crash reports
\end{itemize}

We measure the average detection time, expecting it to grow similarly to $T_{fail}$.
The first detection time will be not much greater than $T_{fail}$.
With catastrophe recovery, we cannot have a correct report earlier than $T_{fail} + T_{miss}$ after the crash.
In general, we expect the maximum delay for detection to never exceed $2 \cdot T_{fail}$, or $2 \cdot (T_{fail} + T_{miss})$ with catastrophe recovery.
Clearly, the actual value depends on the required time needed to spread the information.
